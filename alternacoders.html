<h2>Creating a .bash_profile</h2>
<h2>So this is a little intimidating, you are basically playing with the brain of your computer, but moreso you are preparing your tool set so that your work will be more sophisticated and informed. Also, as long as you pay attention, you will probably not kill your patient.</h2>
<p>cd ~/</p>
<p>~touch .bash_profile / Ubuntu uses ~/.profile This creates a new file</p>
<p>or ~ open ~/.bash_profile Which automatically opens it in TextEdit.</p>
<p>You can also use nano .bash_profile</p>
<p>^= Control</p>
<p>source .bash_profile shows what changes have been made</p>
<h2>Mine looks like this:</h2>
<p>alias ll='ls -ltrahG'</p>
<p>[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" #Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*</p>
<p>export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"</p>
<p># indicates commenting. I like commenting, it makes for a much better experience later, even if it is only me using it. I use Ruby mostly, so that's why I have a ruby specific profile.</p>
